This is the project which won 3rd prize in TECHKRITI IIT KANPUR 2022 in "embedded"
This project is based on home automation using gsm module
components used-
1.gsm sim900A
2.ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
3.arduino uno
4.smoke detector sensor MQ2 
5.16*2 LCD Display with I2C
6.relay module
7.sg90 servo motor
8.A 220 volt AC bulb
9.power bank (to supply arduino dc power)
10.any other AC device you want to control with your phone
11.An airtel sim with recharge(to be placed in gsm module)


now make the connections as per the circuit diagram
the code contains a password protected feature with which one can only have the access with the device once he/she enters the right password
other details are commented in the code about each and every line how the code works
remember to supply all the transducers 5volt from external power supply(don't use the arduino 5volts as all the transducers may consume excess of power making the arduino dead)
